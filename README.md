# Cargo Delivery Optimization System

## Overview
This project implements a cargo delivery optimization system using the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. The system efficiently finds near-optimal delivery routes in dynamic and large-scale networks by simulating the behavior of ant colonies searching for food. The project models delivery points and paths as a weighted graph and dynamically updates routes using pheromone trails.

## Features
- **Graph Representation:** Delivery locations and paths are represented as a weighted graph, where weights reflect distances or costs.
- **Ant Colony Optimization:** Simulates multiple ants exploring the graph to find optimal delivery paths.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Pheromone levels are updated based on route efficiency to guide future optimizations.
- **Scalable Design:** Capable of handling large networks with hundreds of delivery points.

## How It Works

1. **Graph Initialization:**
    - The graph is initialized with delivery locations as nodes and the possible paths between them as edges.
    - Each edge is assigned a weight based on the distance or cost between locations.

2. **Ant Colony Optimization Process:**
    - Multiple ants are deployed on the graph to explore different routes.
    - Each ant maintains a memory of visited nodes to construct viable paths.
    - As ants complete their paths, they deposit pheromones along the edges they traverse.

3. **Pheromone Update:**
    - The amount of pheromone deposited depends on the quality of the path (shorter paths receive more pheromones).
    - Over time, pheromone evaporation prevents convergence to suboptimal routes.

4. **Route Selection:**
    - Paths with higher pheromone concentrations are more likely to be selected by future ants, driving the system towards optimized solutions.

## Algorithms Used
- **Ant Colony Optimization:** Simulates ant behavior to find near-optimal paths.
- **Pheromone Deposition and Evaporation:** Guides the optimization process by balancing exploration and exploitation.
- **Graph Traversal:** Efficiently navigates large networks to update routes dynamically.

## Example Workflow
1. The system initializes a graph with delivery locations and paths.
2. Ants traverse the graph, constructing delivery routes.
3. Pheromones are deposited on successful paths, and routes are iteratively refined.
4. The optimal or near-optimal delivery route is returned.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd DeliveryMapProject/code
    ```

2. Compile the Java file:
    ```bash
    javac MehmetCanGurbuz.java
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    java MehmetCanGurbuz
    ```

## Future Improvements
- Integrate real-time traffic data to further optimize route selection.
- Implement parallel ant simulations for faster convergence.
- Visualize route optimization using a graphical interface.
